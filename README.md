## Step to realise

### 1. Data cleaning

Normally, the first step would be to take a cleaned dataset and iron it to match our needs.  

But we preferred to start again from the uncleaned dataset to redo the cleaning from the beginning, this time directly for our prediction model.  
Since there are two usable raw datasets, we are going to exchange our data with another group and choose the most optimized one for our project.

We must therefore recover and clean the previously scrapped "ImmoCollect" dataset and compare its values with those of our colleague to then choose the most reliable one for our predictions.
